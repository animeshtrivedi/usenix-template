abstract = {Emerging SmartNIC-based disaggregated NVMe storage has become a promising storage infrastructure due to its competitive IO performance and low cost. These SmartNIC JBOFs are shared among multiple co-resident applications, and there is a need for the platform to ensure fairness, QoS, and high utilization. Unfortunately, given the limited computing capability of the SmartNICs and the non-deterministic nature of NVMe drives, it is challenging to provide such support on today's SmartNIC JBOFs.This paper presents Gimbal, a software storage switch that orchestrates IO traffic between Ethernet ports and NVMe drives for co-located tenants. It enables efficient multi-tenancy on SmartNIC JBOFs using the following techniques: a delay-based SSD congestion control algorithm, dynamic estimation of SSD write costs, a fair scheduler that operates at the granularity of a virtual slot, and an end-to-end credit-based flow control channel. Our prototyped system not only achieves up to x6.6 better utilization and 62.6\% less tail latency but also improves the fairness for complex workloads. It also improves a commercial key-value store performance in a multi-tenant environment with x1.7 better throughput and 35.0\% less tail latency on average.},

abstract = {This paper presents the two generations of storage network stacks that reduced the average I/O latency of Alibaba Cloud's EBS service by 72\% in the last five years: Luna, a user-space TCP stack that corresponds the latency of network to the speed of SSD; and Solar, a storage-oriented UDP stack that enables both storage and network hardware accelerations.Luna is our first step towards a high-speed compute-to-storage network in the "storage disaggregation" architecture. Besides the tremendous performance gains and CPU savings compared with the legacy kernel TCP stack, more importantly, it teaches us the necessity of offloading both network and storage into hardware and the importance of recovering instantaneously from network failures.Solar provides a highly reliable and performant storage network running on hardware. For avoiding hardware's resource limitations and offloading storage's entire data path, Solar eliminates the superfluous complexity and the overfull states from the traditional architecture of the storage network. The core design of Solar is unifying the concepts of network packet and storage data block - each network packet is a self-contained storage data block. There are three remarkable advantages to doing so. First, it merges the packet processing and storage virtualization pipelines to bypass the CPU and PCIe; Second, since the storage processes data blocks independently, the packets in Solar become independent. Therefore, the storage (in hardware) does not need to maintain receiving buffers for assembling packets into blocks or handling packet reordering. Finally, due to the low resource requirement and the resilience to packet reordering, Solar inherently supports large-scale multi-path transport for fast failure recovery. Facing the future, Solar demonstrates that we can formalize the storage virtualization procedure into a P4-compatible packet processing pipeline. Hence, SOLAR's design perfectly applies to commodity DPUs (data processing units).},

abstract = {Bare-metal clouds are an emerging infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) that leases physical machines (bare-metal instances) rather than virtual machines, allowing resource-intensive applications to have exclusive access to physical hardware. Unfortunately, bare-metal instances require time-consuming or OS-specific tasks for deployment due to the lack of virtualization layers, thereby sacrificing several beneficial features of traditional IaaS clouds such as agility, elasticity, and OS transparency. We present BMcast, an OS deployment system with a special-purpose de-virtualizable virtual machine monitor (VMM) that supports quick and OS-transparent startup of bare-metal instances. BMcast performs streaming OS deployment while allowing direct access to physical hardware from the guest OS, and then disappears after completing the deployment. Quick startup of instances improves agility and elasticity significantly, and OS transparency greatly simplifies management tasks for cloud customers. Experimental results have confirmed that BMcast initiated a bare-metal instance 8.6 times faster than image copying, and database performance on BMcast during streaming OS deployment was comparable to that on a state-of-the-art VMM without performing deployment. BMcast incurred zero overhead after de-virtualization.},

abstract = {Fast, byte-addressable, persistent main memories (PM) make it possible to build complex data structures that can survive system failures. Programming for PM is challenging, not least because it combines well-known programming challenges like locking, memory management, and pointer safety with novel PM-specific bug types. It also requires logging updates to PM to facilitate recovery after a crash. A misstep in any of these areas can corrupt data, leak resources, or prevent successful recovery after a crash. Existing PM libraries in a variety of languages -- C, C++, Java, Go -- simplify some of these problems, but they still require the programmer to learn (and flawlessly apply) complex rules to ensure correctness. Opportunities for data-destroying bugs abound. This paper presents Corundum, a Rust-based library with an idiomatic PM programming interface and leverages Rust’s type system to statically avoid most common PM programming bugs. Corundum lets programmers develop persistent data structures using familiar Rust constructs and have confidence that they will be free of those bugs. We have implemented Corundum and found its performance to be as good as or better than Intel's widely-used PMDK library, HP's Atlas, Mnemosyne, and go-pmem.},

Twizzler removes the kernel from the I/O path, provides programs with memory-style access to persistent data using small (64&nbsp;bit), object-relative cross-object pointers, and enables simple and efficient long-term sharing of data both between applications and between runs of an application. Twizzler provides a clean-slate programming model for persistent data, realizing the vision of Unix in a world of persistent RAM. We show that Twizzler is simpler, more extensible, and more secure than existing I/O models and implementations by building software for Twizzler and evaluating it on NVM DIMMs. Most persistent pointer operations in Twizzler impose less than 0.5&nbsp;ns added latency. Twizzler operations are up to faster than Unix, and SQLite queries are up to faster than on PMDK. YCSB workloads ran 1.1– faster on Twizzler than on native and NVM-optimized SQLite backends.},

abstract = {Persistent, user-defined objects present an attractive abstraction for working with non-volatile program state. However, the slow speed of persistent storage (i.e., disk) has restricted their design and limited their performance. Fast, byte-addressable, non-volatile technologies, such as phase change memory, will remove this constraint and allow programmers to build high-performance, persistent data structures in non-volatile storage that is almost as fast as DRAM. Creating these data structures requires a system that is lightweight enough to expose the performance of the underlying memories but also ensures safety in the presence of application and system failures by avoiding familiar bugs such as dangling pointers, multiple free()s, and locking errors. In addition, the system must prevent new types of hard-to-find pointer safety bugs that only arise with persistent objects. These bugs are especially dangerous since any corruption they cause will be permanent.We have implemented a lightweight, high-performance persistent object system called NV-heaps that provides transactional semantics while preventing these errors and providing a model for persistence that is easy to use and reason about. We implement search trees, hash tables, sparse graphs, and arrays using NV-heaps, BerkeleyDB, and Stasis. Our results show that NV-heap performance scales with thread count and that data structures implemented using NV-heaps out-perform BerkeleyDB and Stasis implementations by 32x and 244x, respectively, by avoiding the operating system and minimizing other software overheads. We also quantify the cost of enforcing the safety guarantees that NV-heaps provide and measure the costs of NV-heap primitive operations.},

abstract = {The CoRAM memory architecture for FPGA-based computing augments traditional reconfigurable fabric with a natural and effective way for applications to interact with off-chip memory and I/O. The two central tenets of the CoRAM memory architecture are (1) the deliberate separation of concerns between computation versus data marshalling and (2) the use of a multithreaded software abstraction to replace FSM-based memory control logic. To evaluate the viability of the CoRAM memory architecture, we developed a full RTL implementation of a CoRAM microarchitecture instance that can be synthesized for standard cells or emulated on FPGAs. The results of our evaluation show that a soft emulation of the CoRAM memory architecture on current FPGAs can be impractical for memory-intensive, large-scale applications due to the high performance and area penalties incurred by the soft mechanisms. The results further show that in an envisioned FPGA built with CoRAM in mind, the introduction of hard macro blocks for data distribution can mitigate these inefficiencies---allowing applications to take advantage of the CoRAM memory architecture for ease of programmability and portability while still enjoying performance and efficiency comparable to RTL-level application development on conventional FPGAs.},

Each project typically includes tedious development of single-use memory management. Software developers expect a programming environment to include automatic memory management. Virtual memory provides the illusion of very large arrays and processor caches reduce access latency without explicit programmer instructions.LEAP scratchpads for reconfigurable logic dynamically allocate and manage multiple, independent, memory arrays in a large backing store. Scratchpad accesses are cached automatically in multiple levels, ranging from shared on-board, RAM-based, set-associative caches to private caches stored in FPGA RAM blocks. In the LEAP framework, scratchpads share the same interface as on-die RAM blocks and are plug-in replacements. Additional libraries support heap management within a storage set. Like software developers, accelerator authors using scratchpads may focus more on core algorithms and less on memory management.},

abstract = {Read mapping is a fundamental step in many genomics applications. It is used to identify potential matches and differences between fragments (called reads) of a sequenced genome and an already known genome (called a reference genome). Read mapping is costly because it needs to perform approximate string matching (ASM) on large amounts of data. To address the computational challenges in genome analysis, many prior works propose various approaches such as accurate filters that select the reads within a dataset of genomic reads (called a read set) that must undergo expensive computation, efficient heuristics, and hardware acceleration. While effective at reducing the amount of expensive computation, all such approaches still require the costly movement of a large amount of data from storage to the rest of the system, which can significantly lower the end-to-end performance of read mapping in conventional and emerging genomics systems. We propose GenStore, the first in-storage processing system designed for genome sequence analysis that greatly reduces both data movement and computational overheads of genome sequence analysis by exploiting low-cost and accurate in-storage filters. GenStore leverages hardware/software co-design to address the challenges of in-storage processing, supporting reads with 1)&nbsp;different properties such as read lengths and error rates, which highly depend on the sequencing technology, and 2)&nbsp;different degrees of genetic variation compared to the reference genome, which highly depends on the genomes that are being compared. Through rigorous analysis of read mapping processes of reads with different properties and degrees of genetic variation, we meticulously design low-cost hardware accelerators and data/computation flows inside a NAND flash-based solid-state drive (SSD). Our evaluation using a wide range of real genomic datasets shows that GenStore, when implemented in three modern NAND flash-based SSDs, significantly improves the read mapping performance of state-of-the-art software (hardware) baselines by 2.07-6.05\texttimes{} (1.52-3.32\texttimes{}) for read sets with high similarity to the reference genome and 1.45-33.63\texttimes{} (2.70-19.2\texttimes{}) for read sets with low similarity to the reference genome.},

abstract = {With the increasing functionality and complexity of distributed systems, resource failures are inevitable. While numerous models and algorithms for dealing with failures exist, the lack of public trace data sets and tools has prevented meaningful comparisons. To facilitate the design, validation, and comparison of fault-tolerant models and algorithms, we have created the Failure Trace Archive (FTA) as an online public repository of availability traces taken from diverse parallel and distributed systems. Our main contributions in this study are the following. First, we describe the design of the archive, in particular the rationale of the standard FTA format, and the design of a toolbox that facilitates automated analysis of trace data sets. Second, applying the toolbox, we present a uniform comparative analysis with statistics and models of failures in nine distributed systems. Third, we show how different interpretations of these data sets can result in different conclusions. This emphasizes the critical need for the public availability of trace data and methods for their analysis.},

abstract = {The paper motivates, presents, demonstrates in use, and evaluates a methodology for conducting design science (DS) research in information systems (IS). DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},

abstract = {Recent technological advancements have enabled a generation of Ultra-Low Latency (ULL) SSDs that blurs the performance gap between primary and secondary storage devices. However, their power consumption characteristics are largely unknown. In addition, ULL performance in a block device is expected to put extra pressure on operating system components, significantly affecting energy efficiency of the entire system. In this work, we empirically study overall energy efficiency using a real ULL storage device, Optane SSD, a power meter, and a wide range of IO workload behaviors. We present a comparative analysis by laying out several critical observations related to idle vs. active behavior, read vs. write behavior, energy proportionality, impact on system software, as well as impact on overall energy efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published study of a ULL SSD's impact on the system's overall power consumption, which can hopefully lead to future energy-efficient designs.},

However, polling's impact on overall energy efficiency has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, contrary to common belief, we show that polling can also be more energy efficient than interrupt. To do so, we systematically investigate the energy efficiency of all available Linux IO completion mechanisms, including interrupt, classic polling, and hybrid polling using a real ultra-low latency storage device, a power meter, and various workload behaviors. Our experimental results indicate that although hybrid polling provides a good trade-off in CPU utilization, it is the least energy efficient, whereas classic polling is the most energy efficient for low latency IO requests. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper classifying polling as more energy efficient than interrupt for a real secondary storage device, and we hope that our observations will lead to more energy efficient IO completion mechanisms for new generation storage device characteristics.},

However, software storage stack above the device level on most existing mobile platforms is not optimized to exploit the low-energy characteristics of such devices. This paper examines the energy consumption of the storage stack on mobile platforms.We conduct several experiments on mobile platforms to analyze the energy requirements of their respective storage stacks. Software storage stack consumes up to 200 times more energy when compared to storage hardware, and the security and privacy requirements of mobile apps are a major cause. A storage energy model for mobile platforms is proposed to help developers optimize the energy requirements of storage intensive applications. Finally, a few optimizations are proposed to reduce the energy consumption of storage systems on these platforms.},

abstract = {Energy consumption is a key concern for mobile devices. Prior research has focused on the screen and the network as the major sources of energy consumption. Through carefully designed measurement-based experiments, we show that for certain storage-intensive workloads, the storage subsystem on an Android smartphone consumes a significant amount of energy (36%), on par with screen energy consumption. We analyze the energy consumption of different storage primitives, such as sequential and random writes, on two popular mobile file systems, ext4 and F2FS. In addition, since most Android applications use SQLite for storage, we analyze the energy consumption of different SQLite operations. We present several interesting results from our analysis: for example, random writes consume 15\texttimes{} higher energy than sequential writes, and that F2FS consumes half the energy as ext4 for most workloads. We believe our results contribute useful design guidelines for the developers of energy-efficient mobile file systems.},

abstract = {The ongoing shift of cloud services from monolithic designs to mi- croservices creates high demand for efficient and high performance datacenter networking stacks, optimized for fine-grained work- loads. Commodity networking systems based on software stacks and peripheral NICs introduce high overheads when it comes to delivering small messages. We present Dagger, a hardware acceleration fabric for cloud RPCs based on FPGAs, where the accelerator is closely-coupled with the host processor over a configurable memory interconnect. The three key design principle of Dagger are: (1) offloading the entire RPC stack to an FPGA-based NIC, (2) leveraging memory interconnects instead of PCIe buses as the interface with the host CPU, and (3) making the acceleration fabric reconfigurable, so it can accommodate the diverse needs of microservices. We show that the combination of these principles significantly improves the efficiency and performance of cloud RPC systems while preserving their generality. Dagger achieves 1.3 − 3.8\texttimes{} higher per-core RPC throughput compared to both highly-optimized software stacks, and systems using specialized RDMA adapters. It also scales up to 84 Mrps with 8 threads on 4 CPU cores, while maintaining state-of- the-art µs-scale tail latency. We also demonstrate that large third- party applications, like memcached and MICA KVS, can be easily ported on Dagger with minimal changes to their codebase, bringing their median and tail KVS access latency down to 2.8 − 3.5 us and 5.4 − 7.8 us, respectively. Finally, we show that Dagger is beneficial for multi-tier end-to-end microservices with different threading models by evaluating it using an 8-tier application implementing a flight check-in service.},

abstract = {Communication in data-parallel applications often involves a collection of parallel flows. Traditional techniques to optimize flow-level metrics do not perform well in optimizing such collections, because the network is largely agnostic to application-level requirements. The recently proposed coflow abstraction bridges this gap and creates new opportunities for network scheduling. In this paper, we address inter-coflow scheduling for two different objectives: decreasing communication time of data-intensive jobs and guaranteeing predictable communication time. We introduce the concurrent open shop scheduling with coupled resources problem, analyze its complexity, and propose effective heuristics to optimize either objective. We present Varys, a system that enables data-intensive frameworks to use coflows and the proposed algorithms while maintaining high network utilization and guaranteeing starvation freedom. EC2 deployments and trace-driven simulations show that communication stages complete up to 3.16X faster on average and up to 2X more coflows meet their deadlines using Varys in comparison to per-flow mechanisms. Moreover, Varys outperforms non-preemptive coflow schedulers by more than 5X.},

We introduce Molecule, the first serverless computing system utilizing heterogeneous computers. Molecule enables both general-purpose devices (e.g., Nvidia DPU) and domain-specific accelerators (e.g., FPGA and GPU) for serverless applications that significantly improve function density (50% higher) and application performance (up to 34.6x). To achieve these results, we first propose XPU-Shim, a distributed shim to bridge the gap between underlying multi-OS systems (when using general-purpose devices) and our serverless runtime (i.e., Molecule). We further introduce vectorized sandbox, a sandbox abstraction to abstract hardware heterogeneity (when using domain-specific accelerators). Moreover, we also review state-of-the-art serverless optimizations on startup and communication latency and overcome the challenges to implement them on heterogeneous computers. We have implemented Molecule on real platforms with Nvidia DPUs and Xilinx FPGAs and evaluate it using benchmarks and real-world applications.},

abstract = {The Internet use IP addresses to identify and locate network interfaces of connected devices. IPv4 was introduced more than 40 years ago and specifies 32-bit addresses. As the Internet grew, available IPv4 addresses eventually became exhausted more than ten years ago. The IETF designed IPv6 with a much larger addressing space consisting of 128-bit addresses, pushing back the exhaustion problem much further in the future.In this paper, we argue that this large addressing space allows reconsidering how IP addresses are used and enables improving, simplifying and scaling the Internet. By revisiting the IPv6 addressing paradigm, we demonstrate that it opens up several research opportunities that can be investigated today. Hosts can benefit from several IPv6 addresses to improve their privacy, defeat network scanning, improve the use of several mobile access network and their mobility as well as to increase the performance of multicore servers. Network operators can solve the multihoming problem more efficiently and without putting a burden on the BGP RIB, implement Function Chaining with Segment Routing, differentiate routing inside and outside a domain given particular network metrics and offer more fine-grained multicast services.},

abstract = {The advancement of Silicon CMOS technology has led information technology innovation for decades. However, scaling transistors down according to Moore’s law is almost reaching its limitations. To improve system performance, cost, and energy efficiency, vertical-optimization in multiple layers of the computing stack is required. Technological awareness in terms of devices and circuits could enable informed system-level decisions. For example, graphene is a promising material for extremely scaled high-speed transistors because of its remarkably high mobility, but it can not be used in integrated circuits as a result of the high leakage current from its zero bandgap. In this article, we discuss the fundamental physics of transistors and their ramifications on system design to assist device-level technology consideration during system design. Additionally, various emerging devices and their utilization on a vertically-optimized computing stack are introduced. This article serves as a survey of emerging device technologies that may be relevant in these areas, with an emphasis on making the descriptions approachable by system and software designers to understand the potential solutions. A basic vocabulary will be built to understand how to digest technical content, followed by a survey of devices, and finally a discussion of the implications for future processing systems.},

abstract = {This paper explores new opportunities afforded by the growing deployment of compute and I/O accelerators to improve the performance and efficiency of hardware-accelerated computing services in data centers.We propose Lynx, an accelerator-centric network server architecture that offloads the server data and control planes to the SmartNIC, and enables direct networking from accelerators via a lightweight hardware-friendly I/O mechanism. Lynx enables the design of hardware-accelerated network servers that run without CPU involvement, freeing CPU cores and improving performance isolation for accelerated services. It is portable across accelerator architectures and allows the management of both local and remote accelerators, seamlessly scaling beyond a single physical machine.We implement and evaluate Lynx on GPUs and the Intel Visual Compute Accelerator, as well as two SmartNIC architectures - one with an FPGA, and another with an 8-core ARM processor. Compared to a traditional host-centric approach, Lynx achieves over 4X higher throughput for a GPU-centric face verification server, where it is used for GPU communications with an external database, and 25% higher throughput for a GPU-accelerated neural network inference service. For this workload, we show that a single SmartNIC may drive 4 local and 8 remote GPUs while achieving linear performance scaling without using the host CPU.},

abstract = {Modern processors use branch prediction and speculative execution to maximize performance. For example, if the destination of a branch depends on a memory value that is in the process of being read, CPUs will try to guess the destination and attempt to execute ahead. When the memory value finally arrives, the CPU either discards or commits the speculative computation. Speculative logic is unfaithful in how it executes, can access the victim's memory and registers, and can perform operations with measurable side effects.Spectre attacks involve inducing a victim to speculatively perform operations that would not occur during correct program execution and which leak the victim's confidential information via a side channel to the adversary. This paper describes practical attacks that combine methodology from side-channel attacks, fault attacks, and return-oriented programming that can read arbitrary memory from the victim's process. More broadly, the paper shows that speculative execution implementations violate the security assumptions underpinning numerous software security mechanisms, such as operating system process separation, containerization, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, and countermeasures to cache timing and side-channel attacks. These attacks represent a serious threat to actual systems because vulnerable speculative execution capabilities are found in microprocessors from Intel, AMD, and ARM that are used in billions of devices.Although makeshift processor-specific countermeasures are possible in some cases, sound solutions will require fixes to processor designs as well as updates to instruction set architectures (ISAs) to give hardware architects and software developers a common understanding as to what computation state CPU implementations are (and are not) permitted to leak.},

year = {2020},
isbn = {978-1-939133-19-9},
publisher = {USENIX Association},
address = {USA},
abstract = {Today's kernels pay a performance penalty for mitigations-- such as KPTI, retpoline, return stack stuffing, speculation barriers--to protect against transient execution side-channel attacks such as Meltdown [21] and Spectre [16].To address this performance penalty, this paper articulates the unmapped speculation contract, an observation that memory that isn't mapped in a page table cannot be leaked through transient execution. To demonstrate the value of this contract, the paper presents WARD, a new kernel design that maintains a separate kernel page table for every process. This page table contains mappings for kernel memory that is safe to expose to that process. Because a process doesn't map data of other processes, this design allows for many system calls to execute without any mitigation overhead. When a process needs access to sensitive data, WARD switches to a kernel page table that provides access to all of memory and executes with all mitigations.An evaluation of the WARD design implemented in the sv6 research kernel [8] shows that LEBench [24] can execute many system calls without mitigations. For some hardware generations, this results in performance improvement ranging from a few percent (huge page fault) to several factors (getpid), compared to a standard design with mitigations.},

abstract = {Fast non-volatile memories are exposing inefficiencies in traditional I/O stacks. Though there have been fragmented efforts to deal with the issues, there is a pressing need for a high-performance storage stack. Interestingly, 20 years ago, networks were faced with similar challenges, which led to the development of concepts and implementations of multiple high-performance network stacks. In this paper we draw parallels to illustrate synergies between high-performance storage requirements and concepts from the networking space. We identify common high-performance I/O properties and recent efforts in storage to achieve those properties. Instead of reinventing the performance wheel, we advocate a case for using mature high-performance networking abstractions and frameworks to meet the storage demands, and discuss opportunities and challenges that arise with this unification.},

The newest storage API of the Linux kernel is io_uring. We perform one of the first in-depth studies of io_uring, and compare its performance and dis-/advantages with the established libaio and SPDK APIs. Our key findings reveal that (i) polling design significantly impacts performance; (ii) with enough CPU cores io_uring can deliver performance close to that of SPDK; and (iii) performance scalability over multiple CPU cores and devices requires careful consideration and necessitates a hybrid approach. Last, we provide design guidelines for developers of storage intensive applications.},

Nevertheless, current network and storage stacks fail to deliver this hardware performance to the applications, often due to the loss of I/O efficiency from stalled CPU performance. While many efforts attempt to address this issue solely on either the network or the storage stack, achieving high-performance for networked-storage applications requires a holistic approach that considers both.In this article, we present FlashNet, a software I/O stack that unifies high-performance network properties with flash storage access and management. FlashNet builds on RDMA principles and abstractions to provide a direct, asynchronous, end-to-end data path between a client and remote flash storage. The key insight behind FlashNet is to co-design the stack’s components (an RDMA controller, a flash controller, and a file system) to enable cross-stack optimizations and maximize I/O efficiency. In micro-benchmarks, FlashNet improves 4kB network I/O operations per second (IOPS by 38.6% to 1.22M, decreases access latency by 43.5% to 50.4μs, and prolongs the flash lifetime by 1.6-5.9\texttimes{} for writes. We illustrate the capabilities of FlashNet by building a Key-Value store and porting a distributed data store that uses RDMA on it. The use of FlashNet’s RDMA API improves the performance of KV store by 2\texttimes{} and requires minimum changes for the ported data store to access remote flash devices.},

abstract = {Serverless computing promises auto-scalability and cost-efficiency (in "pay-as-you-go" manner) for high-productive software development. Because of its virtue, serverless computing has motivated increasingly new applications and services in the cloud. This, however, also presents new challenges including how to efficiently design high-performance serverless platforms and how to efficiently program on the platforms.This paper proposes ServerlessBench, an open-source benchmark suite for characterizing serverless platforms. It includes test cases exploring characteristic metrics of serverless computing, e.g., communication efficiency, startup latency, stateless overhead, and performance isolation. We have applied the benchmark suite to evaluate the most popular serverless computing platforms, including AWS Lambda, Open-Whisk, and Fn, and present new serverless implications from the study. For example, we show scenarios where decoupling an application into a composition of serverless functions can be beneficial in cost-saving and performance, and that the "stateless" property in serverless computing can hurt the execution performance of serverless functions. These implications form several design guidelines, which may help platform designers to optimize serverless platforms and application developers to design their functions best fit to the platforms.},

abstract = {Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) is a Linux subsystem that allows safely executing untrusted user-defined extensions inside the kernel. It relies on static analysis to protect the kernel against buggy and malicious extensions. As the eBPF ecosystem evolves to support more complex and diverse extensions, the limitations of its current verifier, including high rate of false positives, poor scalability, and lack of support for loops, have become a major barrier for developers.  We design a static analyzer for eBPF within the framework of abstract interpretation. Our choice of abstraction is based on common patterns found in many eBPF programs. We observed that eBPF programs manipulate memory in a rather disciplined way which permits analyzing them successfully with a scalable mixture of very-precise abstraction of certain bounded regions with coarser abstractions of other parts of the memory. We use the Zone domain, a simple domain that tracks differences between pairs of registers and offsets, to achieve precise and scalable analysis. We demonstrate that this abstraction is as precise in practice as more costly abstract domains like Octagon and Polyhedra.  Furthermore, our evaluation, based on hundreds of real-world eBPF programs, shows that the new tool generates no more false alarms than the existing Linux verifier, while it supports a wider class of programs (including programs with loops) and has better asymptotic complexity.},

We then investigate design flows and identify the key challenges in making reconfigurable FPGA systems easier to design. Finally, we look at applications where reconfiguration has found use, as well as proposing new areas where this capability places FPGAs in a unique position for adoption.},

abstract = {C remains the language of choice for hardware programming (device drivers, bus configuration, etc.): it is fast, allows low-level access, and is trusted by OS developers. However, the algorithms required to configure and reconfigure hardware devices and interconnects are becoming more complex and diverse, with the added burden of legacy support, quirks, and hardware bugs to work around. Even programming PCI bridges in a modern PC is a surprisingly complex problem, and is getting worse as new functionality such as hotplug appears. Existing approaches use relatively simple algorithms, hard-coded in C and closely coupled with low-level register access code, generally leading to suboptimal configurations.We investigate the merits and drawbacks of a new approach: separating hardware configuration logic (algorithms to determine configuration parameter values) from mechanism (programming device registers). The latter we keep in C, and the former we encode in a declarative programming language with constraint-satisfaction extensions. As a test case, we have implemented full PCI configuration, resource allocation, and interrupt assignment in the Barrelfish research operating system, using a concise expression of efficient algorithms in constraint logic programming. We show that the approach is tractable, and can successfully configure a wide range of PCs with competitive runtime cost. Moreover, it requires about half the code of the C-based approach in Linux while offering considerably more functionality. Additionally it easily accommodates adaptations such as hotplug, fixed regions, and quirks.},

abstract = {The POSIX standard, developed 25 years ago, comprises a set of operating system (OS) abstractions that aid application portability across UNIX-based OSes. While OSes and applications have evolved tremendously over the last 25 years, POSIX, and the basic set of abstractions it provides, has remained largely unchanged. Little has been done to measure how and to what extent traditional POSIX abstractions are being used in modern OSes, and whether new abstractions are taking form, dethroning traditional ones. We explore these questions through a study of POSIX usage in modern desktop and mobile OSes: Android, OS X, and Ubuntu. Our results show that new abstractions are taking form, replacing several prominent traditional abstractions in POSIX. While the changes are driven by common needs and are conceptually similar across the three OSes, they are not converging on any new standard, increasing fragmentation.},

abstract = {Growth in energy use has slowed owing to efficiency gains that smart policies can help maintain in the near term Data centers represent the information backbone of an increasingly digitalized world. Demand for their services has been rising rapidly (1), and data-intensive technologies such as artificial intelligence, smart and connected energy systems, distributed manufacturing systems, and autonomous vehicles promise to increase demand further (2). Given that data centers are energy-intensive enterprises, estimated to account for around 1\% of worldwide electricity use, these trends have clear implications for global energy demand and must be analyzed rigorously. Several oft-cited yet simplistic analyses claim that the energy used by the world's data centers has doubled over the past decade and that their energy use will triple or even quadruple within the next decade (3–5). Such estimates contribute to a conventional wisdom (5, 6) that as demand for data center services rises rapidly, so too must their global energy use. But such extrapolations based on recent service demand growth indicators overlook strong countervailing energy efficiency trends that have occurred in parallel (see the first figure). Here, we integrate new data from different sources that have emerged recently and suggest more modest growth in global data center energy use (see the second figure). This provides policy-makers and energy analysts a recalibrated understanding of global data center energy use, its drivers, and near-term efficiency potential.}

abstract="There is a large conceptual gap between end-to-end infrastructure requirements and detailed component configuration implementing those requirements. Today, this gap is manually bridged so large numbers of configuration errors are made. Their adverse effects on infrastructure security, availability, and cost of ownership are well documented. This paper presents ConfigAssure to help automatically bridge the above gap. It proposes solutions to four fundamental problems: specification, configuration synthesis, configuration error diagnosis, and configuration error repair. Central to ConfigAssure is a Requirement Solver. It takes as input a configuration database containing variables, and a requirement as a first-order logic constraint in finite domains. The Solver tries to compute as output, values for variables that make the requirement true of the database when instantiated with these values. If unable to do so, it computes a proof of unsolvability. The Requirement Solver is used in different ways to solve the above problems. The Requirement Solver is implemented with Kodkod, a SAT-based model finder for first-order logic. While any requirement can be directly encoded in Kodkod, parts of it can often be solved much more efficiently by non model-finding methods using information available in the configuration database. Solving these parts and simplifying can yield a reduced constraint that truly requires the power of model-finding. To implement this plan, a quantifier-free form, QFF, is defined. A QFF is a Boolean combination of simple arithmetic constraints on integers. A requirement is specified by defining a partial evaluator that transforms it into an equivalent QFF. This QFF is efficiently solved by Kodkod. The partial evaluator is implemented in Prolog. ConfigAssure is shown to be natural and scalable in the context of a realistic, secure and fault-tolerant datacenter.",

abstract = {We present GPUrdma, a GPU-side library for performing Remote Direct Memory Accesses (RDMA) across the network directly from GPU kernels. The library executes no code on CPU, directly accessing the Host Channel Adapter (HCA) Infiniband hardware for both control and data. Slow single-thread GPU performance and the intricacies of the GPU-to-network adapter interaction pose a significant challenge. We describe several design options and analyze their performance implications in detail.We achieve 5μsec one-way communication latency and up to 50Gbit/sec transfer bandwidth for messages from 16KB and larger between K40c NVIDIA GPUs across the network. Moreover, GPUrdma outperforms the CPU RDMA for smaller packets ranging from 2 to 1024 bytes by factor of 4.5x thanks to greater parallelism of transfer requests enabled by highly parallel GPU hardware.We use GPUrdma to implement a subset of the global address space programming interface (GPI) for point-to-point asynchronous RDMA messaging. We demonstrate our preliminary results using two simple applications -- ping-pong and a multi-matrix-vector product with constant matrix and multiple vectors -- each running on two different machines connected by Infiniband. Our basic ping-pong implementation achieves 5%higher performance than the baseline using GPI-2. The improved ping-pong implementation with per-threadblock communication overlap enables further 20% improvement. The multi-matrix-vector product is up to 4.5x faster thanks to higher throughput for small messages and the ability to keep the matrix in fast GPU shared memory while receiving new inputs.GPUrdma prototype is not yet suitable for production systems due to hardware constraints in the current generation of NVIDIA GPUs which we discuss in detail. However, our results highlight the great potential of GPU-side native networking, and encourage further research toward scalable, high-performance, heterogeneous networking infrastructure.},

abstract = {Recent GPUs enable Peer-to-Peer Direct Memory Access (p2p) from fast peripheral devices like NVMe SSDs to exclude the CPU from the data path between them for efficiency. Unfortunately, using p2p to access files is challenging because of the subtleties of low-level non-standard interfaces, which bypass the OS file I/O layers and may hurt system performance. Developers must possess intimate knowledge of low-level interfaces to manually handle the subtleties of data consistency and misaligned accesses.We present SPIN, which integrates p2p into the standard OS file I/O stack, dynamically activating p2p where appropriate, transparently to the user. It combines p2p with page cache accesses, re-enables read-ahead for sequential reads, all while maintaining standard POSIX FS consistency, portability across GPUs and SSDs, and compatibility with virtual block devices such as software RAID.We evaluate SPIN on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs using standard file I/O benchmarks, application traces, and end-to-end experiments. SPIN achieves significant performance speedups across a wide range of workloads, exceeding p2p throughput by up to an order of magnitude. It also boosts the performance of an aerial imagery rendering application by 2.6\texttimes{} by dynamically adapting to its input-dependent file access pattern, enables 3.3\texttimes{} higher throughput for a GPU-accelerated log server, and enables 29% faster execution for the highly optimized GPU-accelerated image collage with only 30 changed lines of code.},

abstract = {Many architects believe that major improvements in cost-energy-performance must now come from domain-specific hardware. This paper evaluates a custom ASIC---called a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) --- deployed in datacenters since 2015 that accelerates the inference phase of neural networks (NN). The heart of the TPU is a 65,536 8-bit MAC matrix multiply unit that offers a peak throughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed on-chip memory. The TPU's deterministic execution model is a better match to the 99th-percentile response-time requirement of our NN applications than are the time-varying optimizations of CPUs and GPUs that help average throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such features helps explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and an Nvidia K80 GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters. Our workload, written in the high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that represent 95% of our datacenters' NN inference demand. Despite low utilization for some applications, the TPU is on average about 15X -- 30X faster than its contemporary GPU or CPU, with TOPS/Watt about 30X -- 80X higher. Moreover, using the CPU's GDDR5 memory in the TPU would triple achieved TOPS and raise TOPS/Watt to nearly 70X the GPU and 200X the CPU.},

abstract = {In the last several years hundreds of thousands of SSDs have been deployed in the data centers of Baidu, China's largest Internet search company. Currently only 40% or less of the raw bandwidth of the flash memory in the SSDs is delivered by the storage system to the applications. Moreover, because of space over-provisioning in the SSD to accommodate non-sequential or random writes, and additionally, parity coding across flash channels, typically only 50-70% of the raw capacity of a commodity SSD can be used for user data. Given the large scale of Baidu's data center, making the most effective use of its SSDs is of great importance. Specifically, we seek to maximize both bandwidth and usable capacity.To achieve this goal we propose {em software-defined flash} (SDF), a hardware/software co-designed storage system to maximally exploit the performance characteristics of flash memory in the context of our workloads. SDF exposes individual flash channels to the host software and eliminates space over-provisioning. The host software, given direct access to the raw flash channels of the SSD, can effectively organize its data and schedule its data access to better realize the SSD's raw performance potential.Currently more than 3000 SDFs have been deployed in Baidu's storage system that supports its web page and image repository services. Our measurements show that SDF can deliver approximately 95% of the raw flash bandwidth and provide 99% of the flash capacity for user data. SDF increases I/O bandwidth by 300% and reduces per-GB hardware cost by 50% on average compared with the commodity-SSD-based system used at Baidu.},

abstract = {Various key-value (KV) stores are widely employed for data management to support Internet services as they offer higher efficiency, scalability, and availability than relational database systems. The log-structured merge tree (LSM-tree) based KV stores have attracted growing attention because they can eliminate random writes and maintain acceptable read performance. Recently, as the price per unit capacity of NAND flash decreases, solid state disks (SSDs) have been extensively adopted in enterprise-scale data centers to provide high I/O bandwidth and low access latency. However, it is inefficient to naively combine LSM-tree-based KV stores with SSDs, as the high parallelism enabled within the SSD cannot be fully exploited. Current LSM-tree-based KV stores are designed without assuming SSD's multi-channel architecture.To address this inadequacy, we propose LOCS, a system equipped with a customized SSD design, which exposes its internal flash channels to applications, to work with the LSM-tree-based KV store, specifically LevelDB in this work. We extend LevelDB to explicitly leverage the multiple channels of an SSD to exploit its abundant parallelism. In addition, we optimize scheduling and dispatching polices for concurrent I/O requests to further improve the efficiency of data access. Compared with the scenario where a stock LevelDB runs on a conventional SSD, the throughput of storage system can be improved by more than 4X after applying all proposed optimization techniques.},

abstract = {Current hardware and application storage trends put immense pressure on the operating system's storage subsystem. On the hardware side, the market for storage devices has diversified to a multi-layer storage topology spanning multiple orders of magnitude in cost and performance. Above the file system, applications increasingly need to process small, random IO on vast data sets with low latency, high throughput, and simple crash consistency. File systems designed for a single storage layer cannot support all of these demands together.We present Strata, a cross-media file system that leverages the strengths of one storage media to compensate for weaknesses of another. In doing so, Strata provides performance, capacity, and a simple, synchronous IO model all at once, while having a simpler design than that of file systems constrained by a single storage device. At its heart, Strata uses a log-structured approach with a novel split of responsibilities among user mode, kernel, and storage layers that separates the concerns of scalable, high-performance persistence from storage layer management. We quantify the performance benefits of Strata using a 3-layer storage hierarchy of emulated NVM, a flash-based SSD, and a high-density HDD. Strata has 20-30% better latency and throughput, across several unmodified applications, compared to file systems purpose-built for each layer, while providing synchronous and unified access to the entire storage hierarchy. Finally, Strata achieves up to 2.8x better throughput than a block-based 2-layer cache provided by Linux's logical volume manager.},

abstract = {Memory-based data center applications require increasingly large memory capacities, but face the challenges posed by the inherent difficulties in scaling DRAM and also the cost of DRAM. Future systems are attempting to address these demands with heterogeneous memory architectures coupling DRAM with high capacity, low cost, but also lower performance, non-volatile memories (NVM) such as PCM and RRAM. A key usage model intended for NVM is as cheaper high capacity volatile memory. Data center operators are bound to ask whether this model for the usage of NVM to replace the majority of DRAM memory leads to a large slowdown in their applications? It is crucial to answer this question because a large performance impact will be an impediment to the adoption of such systems.This paper presents a thorough study of representative applications -- including a key-value store (MemC3), an in-memory database (VoltDB), and a graph analytics framework (GraphMat) -- on a platform that is capable of emulating a mix of memory technologies. Our conclusions are that it is indeed possible to use a mix of a small amount of fast DRAM and large amounts of slower NVM without a proportional impact to an application's performance. The caveat is that this result can only be achieved through careful placement of data structures. The contribution of this paper is the design and implementation of a set of libraries and automatic tools that enables programmers to achieve optimal data placement with minimal effort on their part.With such guided placement and with DRAM constituting only 6% of the total memory footprint for GraphMat and 25% for VoltDB and MemC3 (remaining memory is NVM with 4x higher latency and 8x lower bandwidth than DRAM), we show that our target applications demonstrate only a 13% to 40% slowdown. Without guided placement, these applications see, in the worst case, 1.5x to 5.9x slowdown on the same configuration. Based on a realistic assumption that NVM will be 5x cheaper (per bit) than DRAM, this hybrid solution also results in 2x to 2.8x better performance/$ than a DRAM-only system.},

abstract = {Datacenters act as cloud-infrastructure to stakeholders across industry, government, and academia. To meet growing demand yet operate efficiently, datacenter operators employ increasingly more sophisticated scheduling systems, mechanisms, and policies. Although many scheduling techniques already exist, relatively little research has gone into the abstraction of the scheduling process itself, hampering design, tuning, and comparison of existing techniques. In this work, we propose a reference architecture for datacenter schedulers. The architecture follows five design principles: components with clearly distinct responsibilities, grouping of related components where possible, separation of mechanism from policy, scheduling as complex workflow, and hierarchical multi-scheduler structure. To demonstrate the validity of the reference architecture, we map to it state-of-the-art datacenter schedulers. We find scheduler-stages are commonly underspecified in peer-reviewed publications. Through trace-based simulation and real-world experiments, we show underspecification of scheduler-stages can lead to significant variations in performance.},

We formalize the "unwritten contract" that clients of SSDs should follow to obtain high performance, and conduct our analysis to uncover application and file system designs that violate the contract. Our analysis, which utilizes a highly detailed SSD simulation underneath traces taken from real workloads and file systems, provides insight into how to better construct applications, file systems, and FTLs to realize robust and sustainable performance.},

abstract = {In the last several years hundreds of thousands of SSDs have been deployed in the data centers of Baidu, China's largest Internet search company. Currently only 40% or less of the raw bandwidth of the flash memory in the SSDs is delivered by the storage system to the applications. Moreover, because of space over-provisioning in the SSD to accommodate non-sequential or random writes, and additionally, parity coding across flash channels, typically only 50-70% of the raw capacity of a commodity SSD can be used for user data. Given the large scale of Baidu's data center, making the most effective use of its SSDs is of great importance. Specifically, we seek to maximize both bandwidth and usable capacity.To achieve this goal we propose {em software-defined flash} (SDF), a hardware/software co-designed storage system to maximally exploit the performance characteristics of flash memory in the context of our workloads. SDF exposes individual flash channels to the host software and eliminates space over-provisioning. The host software, given direct access to the raw flash channels of the SSD, can effectively organize its data and schedule its data access to better realize the SSD's raw performance potential.Currently more than 3000 SDFs have been deployed in Baidu's storage system that supports its web page and image repository services. Our measurements show that SDF can deliver approximately 95% of the raw flash bandwidth and provide 99% of the flash capacity for user data. SDF increases I/O bandwidth by 300% and reduces per-GB hardware cost by 50% on average compared with the commodity-SSD-based system used at Baidu.},

abstract = {Data transfers impose a major bottleneck in heterogenous system architectures. As a mitigation strategy, compute resources can be introduced in places where data occurs naturally. The increased diversity of compute resources in turn affects programming models and practicalities of software development for near-data compute kernels and raises the question of how those resources can be made accessible to users and applications.We introduce the Metal FS framework to improve the accessibility of FPGA-based near-storage accelerators: Firstly, we present a near-storage-compute-aware file system that enables self-contained, reusable compute kernels to operate on the granularity of file data streams. Secondly, we provide an integrated build process for FPGA overlay images that starts with the acquisition of compute kernels through a package manager and finally allows to dynamically configure near-storage compute pipelines consisting of them. Thirdly, we integrate the framework into Linux as a file system driver and repurpose Unix Pipes as a well-known operating system primitive to orchestrate near-storage compute pipelines.},

Our prototype system, called Willow, allows programmers to augment and extend the semantics of an SSD with application-specific features without compromising file system protections. The SSD Apps running on Willow give applications low-latency, high-bandwidth access to the SSD's contents while reducing the load that IO processing places on the host processor. The programming model for SSD Apps provides great flexibility, supports the concurrent execution of multiple SSD Apps in Willow, and supports the execution of trusted code in Willow.We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of Willow by implementing six SSD Apps and measuring their performance. We find that defining SSD semantics in software is easy and beneficial, and that Willow makes it feasible for a wide range of IO-intensive applications to benefit from a customized SSD interface.},

abstract = {Thanks to massive parallelism in modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), emerging data processing applications in GPU computing exhibit ten-fold speedups compared to CPU-only systems. However, this GPU-based acceleration is limited in many cases by the significant data movement overheads and inefficient memory management for host-side storage accesses. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes a non-volatile memory management unit (NVMMU) that reduces the file datamovement overheads by directly connecting the Solid State Disk (SSD) to the GPU. We implemented our proposed NVMMU on a real hardware with commercially available GPU and SSD devices by considering different types of storage interfaces and configurations. In this work, NVMMU unifies two discrete software stacks (one for the SSD and other for the GPU) in two major ways. While a new interface provided by our NVMMU directly forwards file data between the GPU runtime library and the I/O runtime library, it supports non-volatile direct memory access (NDMA) that pairs those GPU and SSD devices via physically shared system memory blocks. This unification in turn can eliminate unnecessary user/kernel-mode switching, improve memory management, and remove data copy overheads. Our evaluation results demonstrate that NVMMU can reduce the overheads of file data movement by 95% on average, improving overall system performance by 78% compared to a conventional IOMMU approach.},

We propose a novel Key-Value-based Storage infrastructure for Parallel Computing(KV-SiPC)-a framework for multi-thread OpenMP applications to use NVMe-based KV-SSDs. We design a new capability to execute workloads with multiple parallel data threads along with traditional parallel compute threads, that allow us to improve the overall throughput of applications, utilizing the maximum possible storage bandwidth. We implement our KV-SiPC infrastructure in a real system by extending various processing layers (e.g., program, OS, and device layers) and evaluate the performance of KV-SiPC by using block-based NVMe SSDs in the traditional I/O stack as a baseline for comparisons. The experimental results show that KV-SiPC can better utilize the available device bandwidth and significantly increases application I/O throughput.},

abstract = {Data-intensive queries are common in business intelligence, data warehousing and analytics applications. Typically, processing a query involves full inspection of large in-storage data sets by CPUs. An intuitive way to speed up such queries is to reduce the volume of data transferred over the storage network to a host system. This can be achieved by filtering out extraneous data within the storage, motivating a form of near-data processing. This work presents Biscuit, a novel near-data processing framework designed for modern solid-state drives. It allows programmers to write a data-intensive application to run on the host system and the storage system in a distributed, yet seamless manner. In order to offer a high-level programming model, Biscuit builds on the concept of data flow. Data processing tasks communicate through typed and data-ordered ports. Biscuit does not distinguish tasks that run on the host system and the storage system. As the result, Biscuit has desirable traits like generality and expressiveness, while promoting code reuse and naturally exposing concurrency. We implement Biscuit on a host system that runs the Linux OS and a high-performance solid-state drive. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and implementation with experimental results. When data filtering is done by hardware in the solid-state drive, the average speed-up obtained for the top five queries of TPC-H is over 15\texttimes{}.},

abstract = {Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have gained attention in high-performance computing (HPC) research because their computation and communication capabilities have dramatically improved in recent years as a result of improvements to semiconductor integration technologies that depend on Moore's Law. In addition to FPGA performance improvements, OpenCL-based FPGA development toolchains have been developed and offered by FPGA vendors, which reduces the programming effort required as compared to the past. These improvements reveal the possibilities of realizing a concept to enable on-the-fly offloading computation at which CPUs/GPUs perform poorly to FPGAs while performing low-latency data movement. We think that this concept is one of the keys to more improve the performance of modern heterogeneous supercomputers using accelerators like GPUs. In this paper, we propose high-performance inter-FPGA Ethernet communication using OpenCL and Verilog HDL mixed programming in order to demonstrate the feasibility of realizing this concept. OpenCL is used to program application algorithms and data movement control when Verilog HDL is used to implement low-level components for Ethernet communication. Experimental results using ping-pong programs showed that our proposed approach achieves a latency of 0.99 μs and as much as 4.97 GB/s between FPGAs over different nodes, thus confirming that the proposed method is effective at realizing this concept.},

Using 30 GPU nodes, our simulation can compute a 480x400x80 LBM in 0.31second/step, a speed which is 4.6 times faster than that of our CPU cluster implementation. Besides the LBM, we also discuss other potential applications of the GPU cluster, such as cellular automata, PDE solvers, and FEM.},

So far, the building blocks for supercomputers have been dominated by CPUs and GPUs. Although FPGAs start to play an important role for cloud computing such as those used in AWS and Microsoft Azure, FPGAs haven't been adopted to build top supercomputers yet. In this evening panel, panelists from industry, research institute, and academia will attempt to answer the following questions, propose actions, and present their point of view through lively discussions and debates. 1)Is there a need to bring FPGAs into supercomputers? Why or why not? 2)Are there unique applications that are specifically suitable for FPGAs for supercomputing fields? 3)What are the challenges and/or major issues facing FPGAs for supporting supercomputing? 4)What and where are the opportunities? Who are the stakeholders? 5)Name one thing that the FPGA industry should (or should not) do in the near term to facilitate FPGA's induction into supercomputers.},

abstract = {The overhead of the kernel storage path accounts for half of the access latency for new NVMe storage devices. We explore using BPF to reduce this overhead, by injecting user-defined functions deep in the kernel's I/O processing stack. When issuing a series of dependent I/O requests, this approach can increase IOPS by over 2.5X and cut latency by half, by bypassing kernel layers and avoiding user-kernel boundary crossings. However, we must avoid losing important properties when bypassing the file system and block layer such as the safety guarantees of the file system and translation between physical blocks addresses and file offsets. We sketch potential solutions to these problems, inspired by exokernel file systems from the late 90s, whose time, we believe, has finally come!"As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool repeats his folly."Attributed to King Solomon},

abstract = {We introduce blockNDP, a set of hardware and software protocol and interface extensions to enable block-oriented near data processing (NDP) within emerging solid-state drives (SSDs) integrating processing units. blockNDP is an end-to-end architecture, including a programming model and framework for host and in-storage compute units. blockNDP is the first proposal to be generic, backward compatible - supports existent standards and file systems, portable, and language agnostic. B@We have implemented and evaluated the effectiveness of blockNDP using two full-system prototypes; one on a new NDP emulation platform - developed atop QEMU, and another on an actual development board - the OpenSSD. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that blockNDP is not only feasible with a modest effort, &lt; 10K LoC, but it is also able to achieve up to 4\texttimes{} speedups, despite wimpy CPU cores, on a real-world data-driven application such as MySQL.},

abstract = {The ability to provide differentiated services to users with widely varying requirements is becoming increasingly important, and Internet Service Providers would like to provide these differentiated services using the same shared network infrastructure. The key mechanism, that enables differentiation in a connectionless network, is the packet classification function that parses the headers of the packets, and after determining their context, classifies them based on administrative policies or real-time reservation decisions. Packet classification, however, is a complex operation that can become the bottleneck in routers that try to support gigabit link capacities. Hence, many proposals for differentiated services only require classification at lower speed edge routers and also avoid classification based on multiple fields in the packet header even if it might be advantageous to service providers. In this paper, we present new packet classification schemes that, with a worst-case and traffic-independent performance metric, can classify packets, by checking amongst a few thousand filtering rules, at rates of a million packets per second using range matches on more than 4 packet header fields. For a special case of classification in two dimensions, we present an algorithm that can handle more than 128K rules at these speeds in a traffic independent manner. We emphasize worst-case performance over average case performance because providing differentiated services requires intelligent queueing and scheduling of packets that precludes any significant queueing before the differentiating step (i.e., before packet classification). The presented filtering or classification schemes can be used to classify packets for security policy enforcement, applying resource management decisions, flow identification for RSVP reservations, multicast look-ups, and for source-destination and policy based routing. The scalability and performance of the algorithms have been demonstrated by implementation and testing in a prototype system.},

abstract = {GPUs have long been discussed as accelerators for database query processing because of their high processing power and memory bandwidth. However, two main challenges limit the utility of GPUs for large-scale data processing: (1) the on-board memory capacity is too small to store large data sets, yet (2) the interconnect bandwidth to CPU main-memory is insufficient for ad hoc data transfers. As a result, GPU-based systems and algorithms run into a transfer bottleneck and do not scale to large data sets. In practice, CPUs process large-scale data faster than GPUs with current technology. In this paper, we investigate how a fast interconnect can resolve these scalability limitations using the example of NVLink 2.0. NVLink 2.0 is a new interconnect technology that links dedicated GPUs to a CPU@. The high bandwidth of NVLink 2.0 enables us to overcome the transfer bottleneck and to efficiently process large data sets stored in main-memory on GPUs. We perform an in-depth analysis of NVLink 2.0 and show how we can scale a no-partitioning hash join beyond the limits of GPU memory. Our evaluation shows speed-ups of up to 18x over PCI-e 3.0 and up to 7.3x over an optimized CPU implementation. Fast GPU interconnects thus enable GPUs to efficiently accelerate query processing.},

abstract = {Redundancy elimination using data deduplication and incremental data processing has emerged as an important technique to minimize storage and computation requirements in data center computing. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of Shredder, a high performance content-based chunking framework for supporting incremental storage and computation systems. Shredder exploits the massively parallel processing power of GPUs to overcome the CPU bottlenecks of content-based chunking in a cost-effective manner. Unlike previous uses of GPUs, which have focused on applications where computation costs are dominant, Shredder is designed to operate in both compute-and dataintensive environments. To allow this, Shredder provides several novel optimizations aimed at reducing the cost of transferring data between host (CPU) and GPU, fully utilizing the multicore architecture at the host, and reducing GPU memory access latencies. With our optimizations, Shredder achieves a speedup of over 5X for chunking bandwidth compared to our optimized parallel implementation without a GPU on the same host system. Furthermore, we present two real world applications of Shredder: an extension to HDFS, which serves as a basis for incremental MapReduce computations, and an incremental cloud backup system. In both contexts, Shredder detects redundancies in the input data across successive runs, leading to significant savings in storage, computation, and end-to-end completion times.},

GPUfs provides a POSIX-like API for GPU programs, exploits GPU parallelism for efficiency, and optimizes GPU file access by extending the buffer cache into GPU memory. Our experiments, based on a set of real benchmarks adopted to use our file system, demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of our approach. For example, we demonstrate a simple self-contained GPU program which searches for a set of strings in the entire tree of Linux kernel source files over seven times faster than an eight-core CPU run.},

Programmable accelerators such as smart memory, smart disks, and smart NICs are now being integrated into our systems. Many accelerators can be programmed to process their data autonomously and require little or no intervention during normal operation. In this way, entire applications are offloaded, leaving the CPU with the minimal responsibilities of initialization, coordination and error handling.We claim that these responsibilities can also be handled in simple hardware other than the CPU and that it is wasteful to use a CPU for these purposes. We explore the role and the structure of the OS in a system that has no CPU and demonstrate that all necessary functionality can be moved to other hardware. We show that almost all of the pieces for such a system design are already available today. The responsibilities of the operating system must be split between self-managing devices and a system bus that handles privileged operations.},

We propose an interface to networked storage that reduces an existing software implementation of a distributed shared log to hardware.

abstract = {Using flash-based solid state drives (SSDs) as main memory has been proposed as a practical solution towards scaling memory capacity for data-intensive applications. However, almost all existing approaches rely on the paging mechanism to move data between SSDs and host DRAM. This inevitably incurs significant performance overhead and extra I/O traffic. Thanks to the byte-addressability supported by the PCIe interconnect and the internal memory in SSD controllers, it is feasible to access SSDs in both byte and block granularity today. Exploiting the benefits of SSD's byte-accessibility in today's memory-storage hierarchy is, however, challenging as it lacks systems support and abstractions for programs. In this paper, we present FlatFlash, an optimized unified memory-storage hierarchy, to efficiently use byte-addressable SSD as part of the main memory. We extend the virtual memory management to provide a unified memory interface so that programs can access data across SSD and DRAM in byte granularity seamlessly. We propose a lightweight, adaptive page promotion mechanism between SSD and DRAM to gain benefits from both the byte-addressable large SSD and fast DRAM concurrently and transparently, while avoiding unnecessary page movements. Furthermore, we propose an abstraction of byte-granular data persistence to exploit the persistence nature of SSDs, upon which we rethink the design primitives of crash consistency of several representative software systems that require data persistence, such as file systems and databases. Our evaluation with a variety of applications demonstrates that, compared to the current unified memory-storage systems, FlatFlash improves the performance for memory-intensive applications by up to 2.3x, reduces the tail latency for latency-critical applications by up to 2.8x, scales the throughput for transactional database by up to 3.0x, and decreases the meta-data persistence overhead for file systems by up to 18.9x. FlatFlash also improves the cost-effectiveness by up to 3.8x compared to DRAM-only systems, while enhancing the SSD lifetime significantly.},

It is important since a data center comprises thousands of machines and thus a single-digit performance improvement can significantly reduce cost and power consumption. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult as data centers are dynamic environments where applications are frequently released and servers are continually upgraded.In this paper, we study the effectiveness of different processor prefetch configurations, which can greatly influence the performance of memory system and the overall data center. We observe a wide performance gap when comparing the worst and best configurations, from 1.4% to 75.1%, for 11 important data center applications. We then develop a tuning framework which attempts to predict the optimal configuration based on hardware performance counters. The framework achieves performance within 1% of the best performance of any single configuration for the same set of applications.},

abstract = {As Linux runs an increasing variety of workloads, its in-kernel readahead algorithm has been challenged by many unexpected and subtle problems. To name a few: readahead thrashings arise when readahead pages are evicted prematurely under memory pressure; readahead attempts on already cached pages are undesirable; interrupted-then-retried reads and locally disordered NFS reads that can easily fool the sequential detection logic. In this paper, we present a new Linux readahead framework with flexible and robust heuristics that can cover varied sequential I/O patterns. It also enjoys great simplicity by handling most abnormal cases in an implicit way. We demonstrate its advantages by a host of case studies. Network throughput is 3 times better in the case of thrashing and 1.8 times better for large NFS files. On serving large files with lighttpd, the disk utilization is decreased by 26% while providing 17% more network throughput.},

abstract="Flash based solid state drives (SSDs) have established themselves as a higher-performance alternative to hard disk drives in cloud and mobile environments. Nevertheless, SSDs remain a performance bottleneck of computer systems due to their high I/O access latency. A common approach for improving the access latency is prefetching. Prefetching predicts future block accesses and preloads them into main memory ahead of time. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of prefetching in SSDs, explain why prior approaches fail to achieve high accuracy, and present a neural network based prefetching approach that significantly outperforms the state-of the-art. To achieve high performance, we address the challenges of prefetching in very large sparse address spaces, as well as prefetching in a timely manner by predicting ahead of time. We collect I/O trace files from several real-world applications running on cloud servers and show that our proposed approach consistently outperforms the existing stride prefetchers by up to 800{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}{\texttimes}and prior prefetching approaches based on Markov chains by up to 8{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}{\texttimes}. Furthermore, we propose an address mapping learning technique to demonstrate the applicability of our approach to previously unseen SSD workloads and perform a hyperparameter sensitivity study.",

abstract = {FPGAs offer compelling acceleration opportunities for modern applications. However compilation for FPGAs is painfully slow, potentially requiring hours or longer. We approach this problem with a solution from the software domain: the use of a JIT. Code is executed immediately in a software simulator, and compilation is performed in the background. When finished, the code is moved into hardware, and from the user's perspective it simply gets faster. We have embodied these ideas in Cascade: the first JIT compiler for Verilog. Cascade reduces the time between initiating compilation and running code to less than a second, and enables generic printf debugging from hardware. Cascade preserves program performance to within 3\texttimes{} in a debugging environment, and has minimal effect on a finalized design. Crucially, these properties hold even for programs that perform side effects on connected IO devices. A user study demonstrates the value to experts and non-experts alike: Cascade encourages more frequent compilation, and reduces the time to produce working hardware designs.},

abstract = {Industry is increasingly turning to reconfigurable architectures like FPGAs and CGRAs for improved performance and energy efficiency. Unfortunately, adoption of these architectures has been limited by their programming models. HDLs lack abstractions for productivity and are difficult to target from higher level languages. HLS tools are more productive, but offer an ad-hoc mix of software and hardware abstractions which make performance optimizations difficult.  In this work, we describe a new domain-specific language and compiler called Spatial for higher level descriptions of application accelerators. We describe Spatial's hardware-centric abstractions for both programmer productivity and design performance, and summarize the compiler passes required to support these abstractions, including pipeline scheduling, automatic memory banking, and automated design tuning driven by active machine learning. We demonstrate the language's ability to target FPGAs and CGRAs from common source code. We show that applications written in Spatial are, on average, 42% shorter and achieve a mean speedup of 2.9x over SDAccel HLS when targeting a Xilinx UltraScale+ VU9P FPGA on an Amazon EC2 F1 instance.},

abstract = {Many versions of Unix provide facilities for user-level packet capture, making possible the use of general purpose workstations for network monitoring. Because network monitors run as user-level processes, packets must be copied across the kernel/user-space protection boundary. This copying can be minimized by deploying a kernel agent called a packet filter, which discards unwanted packets as early as possible. The original Unix packet filter was designed around a stack-based filter evaluator that performs sub-optimally on current RISC CPUs. The BSD Packet Filter (BPF) uses a new, register-based filter evaluator that is up to 20 times faster than the original design. BPF alson uses a straighforward buffering strategy that makes its overall performance up to 100 times faster than Sun's NIT running on the same hardware.},

We implement our ideas in Caribou, an intelligent distributed storage layer incorporating many of the lessons learned while building systems with specialized hardware. Caribou provides access to DRAM/NVRAM storage over the network through a simple key-value store interface, with each storage node providing high-bandwidth near-data processing at line rate and fault tolerance through replication. The result is a highly efficient, distributed, intelligent data storage that can be used to both boost performance and reduce power consumption and real estate usage in the data center thanks to the micro-server architecture adopted.},

abstract = {Genomics is transforming medicine and our understanding of life in fundamental ways. Genomics data, however, is far outpacing Moore»s Law. Third-generation sequencing technologies produce 100X longer reads than second generation technologies and reveal a much broader mutation spectrum of disease and evolution. However, these technologies incur prohibitively high computational costs. Over 1,300 CPU hours are required for reference-guided assembly of the human genome, and over 15,600 CPU hours are required for de novo assembly. This paper describes "Darwin" --- a co-processor for genomic sequence alignment that, without sacrificing sensitivity, provides up to $15,000X speedup over the state-of-the-art software for reference-guided assembly of third-generation reads. Darwin achieves this speedup through hardware/algorithm co-design, trading more easily accelerated alignment for less memory-intensive filtering, and by optimizing the memory system for filtering. Darwin combines a hardware-accelerated version of D-SOFT, a novel filtering algorithm, alignment at high speed, and with a hardware-accelerated version of GACT, a novel alignment algorithm. GACT generates near-optimal alignments of arbitrarily long genomic sequences using constant memory for the compute-intensive step. Darwin is adaptable, with tunable speed and sensitivity to match emerging sequencing technologies and to meet the requirements of genomic applications beyond read assembly.},

abstract = {This paper revisits Peer-to-Peer DMA (P2P DMA) and investigates its potential for exploitation on Ethernet NICs and NVMe SSDs. The slowing performance improvement of CPUs has led to emergence of peripheral accelerators such as Smart NICs and TPU. P2P DMA presents potential for the efficient integration of multiple peripherals by avoiding data bouncing on main memory. However, P2P DMA has been studied mainly around GPUs, and its improvement has been measured for specific applications. In this paper, we perform experiments to clarify the benefits of using P2P DMA on individual devices, i.e., an Ethernet NIC and an NVMe SSD, from an I/O throughput perspective. We developed a library, called Libpop, for manipulating memory on devices for invoking P2P DMA. Additionally, we integrated Libpop into pcie-bench, which is an FPGA-based benchmark device, netmap for Ethernet NICs, and UNVMe for NVMe SSDs. Experiments with these implementations show that (1) memory writes degrade the throughput of DMA write by 70%, (2) the degradation affects I/O throughput on the devices, and (3) P2P DMA can avoid degradation, but device queues affect throughput on the Ethernet NIC.},

abstract = {Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have been integrated into the cloud infrastructure to enhance its computing performance by supporting on-demand acceleration. However, system support for FPGAs in the context of the cloud environment is still in its infancy with two major limitations, i.e., the inefficient runtime management due to the tight coupling between compilation and resource allocation, and the high programming complexity when exploiting scale-out acceleration. The root cause is that FPGA resources are not virtualized. In this paper, we propose a full-stack solution, namely ViTAL, to address the aforementioned limitations by virtualizing FPGA resources. Specifically, ViTAL provides a homogeneous abstraction to decouple the compilation and resource allocation. Applications are offline compiled onto the abstraction, while the resource allocation is dynamically determined at runtime. Enabled by a latency-insensitive communication interface, applications can be mapped flexibly onto either one FPGA or multiple FPGAs to maximize the resource utilization and the aggregated system throughput. Meanwhile, ViTAL creates an illusion of a single and large FPGA to users, thereby reducing the programming complexity and supporting scale-out acceleration. Moreover, ViTAL also provides virtualization support for peripheral components (e.g., on-board DRAM and Ethernet), as well as protection and isolation support to ensure a secure execution in the multi-user cloud environment. We evaluate ViTAL on a real system - an FPGA cluster composed of the latest Xilinx UltraScale+ FPGAs (XCVU37P). The results show that, compared with the existing management method, ViTAL enables fine-grained resource sharing and reduces the response time by 82% on average (improving Quality-of-Service) with a marginal virtualization overhead. Moreover, ViTAL also reduces the response time by 25% compared to AmorphOS (operating in high-throughput mode), a recently proposed FPGA virtualization method.},

month = {April},
abstract = {In recent years, advances in computer architecture have slowed dramatically with most simulation results demonstrating only incremental architectural innovation. This is further exacerbated by increased processor and system complexity spurred by a seemingly unlimited number of transistors at computer architect’s disposal. Computer architects produce a myopic view of their systems through the lens of slow, highly-detailed software simulation or fast, coarse-grained software simulation, with fidelity always in question.

By leveraging silicon technology scaling in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), hardware can be used to accelerate simulation, emulation, or prototyping of systems. Furthermore, because the base components are reconfigurable, the same system can be used for a variety of research projects, amortizing the cost, both in dollars and in learning time. In this paper, we present the third generation of the Berkeley Emulation Engine or BEE3 system. We demonstrate a new collaboration methodology between academia and industry and compare the industrial and academic system design process. The BEE3 is a production multi-FPGA system with up to 64 GB of DRAM and several I/O subsystems that can be used to enable faster, larger and higher fidelity computer architecture or other systems research. Using a widely available hardware platform also facilitates a software community that can generate and share software modules, thereby enabling rapid system development for computer architecture research.},

abstract = {Complex data queries, because of their need for random accesses, have proven to be slow unless all the data can be accommodated in DRAM. There are many domains, such as genomics, geological data and daily twitter feeds where the datasets of interest are 5TB to 20 TB. For such a dataset, one would need a cluster with 100 servers, each with 128GB to 256GBs of DRAM, to accommodate all the data in DRAM. On the other hand, such datasets could be stored easily in the flash memory of a rack-sized cluster. Flash storage has much better random access performance than hard disks, which makes it desirable for analytics workloads. In this paper we present BlueDBM, a new system architecture which has flash-based storage with in-store processing capability and a low-latency high-throughput inter-controller network. We show that BlueDBM outperforms a flash-based system without these features by a factor of 10 for some important applications. While the performance of a ram-cloud system falls sharply even if only 5%~10% of the references are to the secondary storage, this sharp performance degradation is not an issue in BlueDBM. BlueDBM presents an attractive point in the cost-performance trade-off for Big Data analytics.},

abstract = {A key-value store (KVS), such as memcached and Redis, is widely used as a caching layer to augment the slower persistent backend storage in data centers. DRAM-based KVS provides fast key-value access, but its scalability is limited by the cost, power and space needed by the machine cluster to support a large amount of DRAM. This paper offers a 10X to 100X cheaper solution based on flash storage and hardware accelerators. In BlueCache key-value pairs are stored in flash storage and all KVS operations, including the flash controller are directly implemented in hardware. Furthermore, BlueCache includes a fast interconnect between flash controllers to provide a scalable solution. We show that BlueCache has 4.18X higher throughput and consumes 25X less power than a flash-backed KVS software implementation on x86 servers. We further show that BlueCache can outperform DRAM-based KVS when the latter has more than 7.4% misses for a read-intensive aplication. BlueCache is an attractive solution for both rack-level appliances and data-center-scale key-value cache.},

abstract = {Providing low-latency access to large amounts of data is one of the foremost requirements for many web services. To address these needs, systems such as Memcached have been created which provide a distributed, all in-memory key-value store. These systems are critical and often deployed across hundreds or thousands of servers. However, these systems are not well matched for commodity servers, as they require significant CPU resources to achieve reasonable network bandwidth, yet the core Memcached functions do not benefit from the high performance of standard server CPUs. In this paper, we demonstrate the design of an FPGA-based Memcached appliance. We take Memcached, a complex software system, and implement its core functionality on an FPGA. By leveraging the FPGA's design and utilizing its customizable logic to create a specialized appliance we are able to tightly integrate networking, compute, and memory. This integration allows us to overcome many of the bottlenecks found in standard servers. Our design provides performance on-par with baseline servers, but consumes only 9% of the power of the baseline. Scaled out, we see benefits at the data center level, substantially improving the performance-per-dollar while improving energy efficiency by 3.2X to 10.9X.},

abstract = {PCIe-based Flash is commonly deployed to provide datacenter applications with high IO rates. However, its capacity and bandwidth are often underutilized as it is difficult to design servers with the right balance of CPU, memory and Flash resources over time and for multiple applications. This work examines Flash disaggregation as a way to deal with Flash overprovisioning. We tune remote access to Flash over commodity networks and analyze its impact on workloads sampled from real datacenter applications. We show that, while remote Flash access introduces a 20% throughput drop at the application level, disaggregation allows us to make up for these overheads through resource-efficient scale-out. Hence, we show that Flash disaggregation allows scaling CPU and Flash resources independently in a cost effective manner. We use our analysis to draw conclusions about data and control plane issues in remote storage.},

abstract = {In multi-tenant systems, the CPU overhead of distributed file systems (DFSes) is increasingly a burden to application performance. CPU and memory interference cause degraded and unstable application and storage performance, in particular for operation latency. Recent client-local DFSes for persistent memory (PM) accelerate this trend. DFS offload to SmartNICs is a promising solution to these problems, but it is challenging to fit the complex demands of a DFS onto simple SmartNIC processors located across PCIe.We present LineFS, a SmartNIC-offloaded, high-performance DFS with support for client-local PM. To fully leverage the SmartNIC architecture, we decompose DFS operations into execution stages that can be offloaded to a parallel datapath execution pipeline on the SmartNIC. LineFS offloads CPU-intensive DFS tasks, like replication, compression, data publication, index and consistency management to a Smart-NIC. We implement LineFS on the Mellanox BlueField Smart-NIC and compare it to Assise, a state-of-the-art PM DFS. LineFS improves latency in LevelDB up to 80% and throughput in Filebench up to 79%, while providing extended DFS availability during host system failures.},

abstract = {Hybrid computing platforms, comprising CPU cores and FPGA logic, are increasingly used for accelerating data-intensive workloads in cloud deployments, and are a growing topic of interest in systems research. However, from a research perspective, existing hardware platforms are limited: they are often optimized for concrete, narrow use-cases and, therefore lack the flexibility needed to explore other applications and configurations.  We show that a research group can design and build a more general, open, and affordable hardware platform for hybrid systems research. The platform, Enzian, is capable of duplicating the functionality of existing CPU/FPGA systems with comparable performance but in an open, flexible system. It couples a large FPGA with a server-class CPU in an asymmetric cache-coherent NUMA system. Enzian also enables research not possible with existing hybrid platforms, through explicit access to coherence messages, extensive thermal and power instrumentation, and an open, programmable baseboard management processor.  Enzian is already being used in multiple projects, is open source (both hardware and software), and available for remote use. We present the design principles of Enzian, the challenges in building it, and evaluate it with a range of existing research use-cases alongside other, more specialized platforms, as well as demonstrating research not possible on existing platforms.},

abstract = {FPGA-based accelerators are demonstrating significant absolute performance and energy efficiency compared with general-purpose CPUs. While FPGA computations can now be described in standard, programming languages, like C, development for FPGAs accelerators remains tedious and inaccessible to modern software engineers. Slow compiles (potentially taking tens of hours) inhibit the rapid, incremental refinement of designs that is the hallmark of modern software engineering. To address this issue, we introduce separate compilation and linkage into the FPGA design flow, providing faster design turns more familiar to software development. To realize this flow, we provide abstractions, compiler options, and compiler flow that allow the same C source code to be compiled to processor cores in seconds and to FPGA regions in minutes, providing the missing -O0 and -O1 options familiar in software development. This raises the FPGA programming level and standardizes the programming experience, bringing FPGA-based accelerators into a more familiar software platform ecosystem for software engineers.},

abstract = {Software and hardware development cycles have traditionally been quite distinct. Software allows post-deployment patches, which leads to a rapid development cycle. In contrast, hardware bugs that are found after fabrication are extremely costly to fix (and sometimes even unfixable), so the traditional hardware development cycle involves massive investment in extensive simulation and formal verification. Reconfigurable hardware, such as a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), promises to propel hardware development towards an agile software-like development approach, since it enables a hardware developer to patch bugs that are detected during on-chip testing or in production. Unfortunately, FPGA programmers lack bug localization tools amenable to this rapid development cycle, since past tools mainly find bugs via simulation and verification. To develop hardware bug localization tools for a rapid development cycle, a thorough understanding of the symptoms, root causes, and fixes of hardware bugs is needed.  In this paper, we first study bugs in existing FPGA designs and produce a testbed of reliably-reproducible bugs. We classify the bugs according to their intrinsic properties, symptoms, and root causes. We demonstrate that many hardware bugs are comparable to software bug counterparts, and would benefit from similar techniques for bug diagnosis and repair. Based upon our findings, we build a novel collection of hybrid static/dynamic program analysis and monitoring tools for debugging FPGA designs, showing that our tools enable a software-like development cycle by effectively reducing developers' manual efforts for bug localization.},

We present ShEF, a trusted execution environment (TEE) for cloud-based reconfigurable accelerators. ShEF is independent from CPU-based TEEs and allows secure execution under a threat model where the adversary can control all software running on the CPU connected to the FPGA, has physical access to the FPGA, and can compromise the FPGA interface logic of the cloud provider. ShEF provides a secure boot and remote attestation process that relies solely on existing FPGA mechanisms for root of trust. It also includes a Shield component that provides secure access to data while the accelerator is in use. The Shield is highly customizable and extensible, allowing users to craft a bespoke security solution that fits their accelerator's memory access patterns, bandwidth, and security requirements at minimum performance and area overheads. We describe a prototype implementation of ShEF for existing cloud FPGAs, map ShEF to a performant and secure storage application, and measure the performance benefits of customizable security using five additional accelerators.},

abstract = {Since 2005, processor designers have increased core counts to exploit Moore's Law scaling, rather than focusing on single-core performance. The failure of Dennard scaling, to which the shift to multicore parts is partially a response, may soon limit multicore scaling just as single-core scaling has been curtailed. This paper models multicore scaling limits by combining device scaling, single-core scaling, and multicore scaling to measure the speedup potential for a set of parallel workloads for the next five technology generations. For device scaling, we use both the ITRS projections and a set of more conservative device scaling parameters. To model single-core scaling, we combine measurements from over 150 processors to derive Pareto-optimal frontiers for area/performance and power/performance. Finally, to model multicore scaling, we build a detailed performance model of upper-bound performance and lower-bound core power. The multicore designs we study include single-threaded CPU-like and massively threaded GPU-like multicore chip organizations with symmetric, asymmetric, dynamic, and composed topologies. The study shows that regardless of chip organization and topology, multicore scaling is power limited to a degree not widely appreciated by the computing community. Even at 22 nm (just one year from now), 21% of a fixed-size chip must be powered off, and at 8 nm, this number grows to more than 50%. Through 2024, only 7.9x average speedup is possible across commonly used parallel workloads, leaving a nearly 24-fold gap from a target of doubled performance per generation.},

abstract = {Conventional homogeneous multicore processors are not able to provide the continued performance and energy improvement that we have expected from past endeavors. Heterogeneous architectures that feature specialized hardware accelerators are widely considered a promising paradigm for resolving this issue. Among different heterogeneous devices, FPGAs that can be reconfigured to accelerate a broad class of applications with orders-of-magnitude performance/watt gains, are attracting increased attention from both academia and industry. As a consequence, a variety of CPU-FPGA acceleration platforms with diversified microarchitectural features have been supplied by industry vendors. Such diversity, however, poses a serious challenge to application developers in selecting the appropriate platform for a specific application or application domain.This article aims to address this challenge by determining which microarchitectural characteristics affect performance, and in what ways. Specifically, we conduct a quantitative comparison and an in-depth analysis on five state-of-the-art CPU-FPGA acceleration platforms: (1) the Alpha Data board and (2) the Amazon F1 instance that represent the traditional PCIe-based platform with private device memory; (3) the IBM CAPI that represents the PCIe-based system with coherent shared memory; (4) the first generation of the Intel Xeon+FPGA Accelerator Platform that represents the QPI-based system with coherent shared memory; and (5) the second generation of the Intel Xeon+FPGA Accelerator Platform that represents a hybrid PCIe-based (non-coherent) and QPI-based (coherent) system with shared memory. Based on the analysis of their CPU-FPGA communication latency and bandwidth characteristics, we provide a series of insights for both application developers and platform designers. Furthermore, we conduct two case studies to demonstrate how these insights can be leveraged to optimize accelerator designs. The microbenchmarks used for evaluation have been released for public use.},

abstract = {Cloud providers widely deploy FPGAs as application-specific accelerators for customer use. These providers seek to multiplex their FPGAs among customers via virtualization, thereby reducing running costs. Unfortunately, most virtualization support is confined to FPGAs that expose a restrictive, host-centric programming model in which accelerators cannot issue direct memory accesses (DMAs). The host-centric model incurs high runtime overhead for workloads that exhibit pointer chasing. Thus, FPGAs are beginning to support a shared-memory programming model in which accelerators can issue DMAs. However, virtualization support for shared-memory FPGAs is limited. This paper presents Optimus, the first hypervisor that supports scalable shared-memory FPGA virtualization. Optimus offers both spatial multiplexing and temporal multiplexing to provide efficient and flexible sharing of each accelerator on an FPGA. To share the FPGA-CPU interconnect at a high clock frequency, Optimus implements a multiplexer tree. To isolate each guest's address space, Optimus introduces the technique of page table slicing as a hardware-software co-design. To support preemptive temporal multiplexing, Optimus provides an accelerator preemption interface. We show that Optimus supports eight physical accelerators on a single FPGA and improves the aggregate throughput of twelve real-world benchmarks by 1.98x-7x.},

This work investigates the utility of these four actuators, and quantifies the power-performance tradeoffs associated with them. Using replicas of the German Wikipedia running on our local testbed, we perform a set of experiments to quantify the influence of DVFS, vertical and horizontal scaling, and CPU pinning on end-to-end response time (average and tail), throughput, and power consumption with different workloads. Results of the experiments show that DVFS rarely reduces the power consumption of underloaded servers by more than 5%, but it can be used to limit the maximal power consumption of a saturated server by up to 20% (at a cost of performance degradation). CPU pinning reduces the power consumption of underloaded server (by up to 7%) at the cost of performance degradation, which can be limited by choosing an appropriate CPU pinning scheme. Horizontal and vertical scaling improves both the average and tail response time, but the improvement is not proportional to the amount of resources added. The load balancing strategy has a big impact on the tail response time of horizontally scaled applications.}

abstract = {Much of the success of the Internet services model can be attributed to the popularity of a class of workloads that we call Online Data-Intensive (OLDI) services. These workloads perform significant computing over massive data sets per user request but, unlike their offline counterparts (such as MapReduce computations), they require responsiveness in the sub-second time scale at high request rates. Large search products, online advertising, and machine translation are examples of workloads in this class. Although the load in OLDI services can vary widely during the day, their energy consumption sees little variance due to the lack of energy proportionality of the underlying machinery. The scale and latency sensitivity of OLDI workloads also make them a challenging target for power management techniques.We investigate what, if anything, can be done to make OLDI systems more energy-proportional. Specifically, we evaluate the applicability of active and idle low-power modes to reduce the power consumed by the primary server components (processor, memory, and disk), while maintaining tight response time constraints, particularly on 95th-percentile latency. Using Web search as a representative example of this workload class, we first characterize a production Web search workload at cluster-wide scale. We provide a fine-grain characterization and expose the opportunity for power savings using low-power modes of each primary server component. Second, we develop and validate a performance model to evaluate the impact of processor- and memory-based low-power modes on the search latency distribution and consider the benefit of current and foreseeable low-power modes. Our results highlight the challenges of power management for this class of workloads. In contrast to other server workloads, for which idle low-power modes have shown great promise, for OLDI workloads we find that energy-proportionality with acceptable query latency can only be achieved using coordinated, full-system active low-power modes.},

isbn = {9781450316422},
publisher = {IEEE Computer Society},
address = {USA},
abstract = {Most modern cores perform a highly-associative transaction look aside buffer (TLB) lookup on every memory access. These designs often hide the TLB lookup latency by overlapping it with L1 cache access, but this overlap does not hide the power dissipated by TLB lookups. It can even exacerbate the power dissipation by requiring higher associativity L1 cache. With today's concern for power dissipation, designs could instead adopt a virtual L1 cache, wherein TLB access power is dissipated only after L1 cache misses. Unfortunately, virtual caches have compatibility issues, such as supporting writeable synonyms and x86's physical page table walker.This work proposes an Opportunistic Virtual Cache (OVC) that exposes virtual caching as a dynamic optimization by allowing some memory blocks to be cached with virtual addresses and others with physical addresses. OVC relies on small OS changes to signal which pages can use virtual caching (e.g., no writeable synonyms), but defaults to physical caching for compatibility. We show OVC's promise with analysis that finds virtual cache problems exist, but are dynamically rare. We change 240 lines in Linux 2.6.28 to enable OVC. On experiments with Parsec and commercial workloads, the resulting system saves 94-99% of TLB lookup energy and nearly 23% of L1 cache dynamic lookup energy.},

abstract = {Power consumption and power density for the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) are important considerations not only in its design, but can have a consequence on cache design as well. This paper embarks on a new philosophy for reducing the number of accesses to the instruction TLB (iTLB) for power and performance optimizations. The overall idea is to keep a translation currently being used in a register and avoid going to the iTLB as far as possible --- until there is a page change. We propose four different approaches for achieving this, and experimentally demonstrate that one of these schemes that uses a combination of compiler and hardware enhancements can reduce iTLB dynamic power by over 85% in most cases.These mechanisms can work with different instructioncache (iL1) lookup mechanisms and achieve significant iTLB power savings without compromising on performance. Their importance grows with higher iL1 miss rates and larger page sizes. They can work very well with large iTLB structures, that can possibly consume more power and take longer to lookup, without the iTLB getting into the common case. Further, we also experimentally demonstrate that they can provide performance savings for virtually-indexed, virtually-tagged iL1 caches, and can even make physically indexed, physically-tagged iL1 caches a possible choice for implementation.},

The power inefficiency and nondeterministic execution times of address-translation mechanisms have been major barriers in adopting and utilizing the benefits of virtual memory in embedded processors with low-power and real-time constraints. To address this problem, we propose a novel, Customizable Translation Table (CTT) organization, where application knowledge regarding the virtual memory footprint is used in order to eliminate conflicts in the hardware translation buffer and, thus, achieve tag-free address translation lookups. The set of virtual pages is partitioned into groups, such that for each group only a few of the least significant bits are used as an index to obtain the physical page number. We outline an efficient compile-time algorithm for identifying these groups and allocate their translation entries optimally into the CTT. The proposed methodology relies on the combined efforts of compiler, operating system, and hardware architecture to achieve a significant power reduction. The experiments that we have performed on a set of embedded applications show power reductions in the range of 55% to 80% compared to a general- purpose Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB).},

abstract = {Processors and operating systems (OSes) support multiple memory page sizes. Superpages increase Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) hits, while small pages provide fine-grained memory protection. Ideally, TLBs should perform well for any distribution of page sizes. In reality, set-associative TLBs -- used frequently for their energy efficiency compared to fully-associative TLBs -- cannot (easily) support multiple page sizes concurrently. Instead, commercial systems typically implement separate set-associative TLBs for different page sizes. This means that when superpages are allocated aggressively, TLB misses may, counter intuitively, increase even if entries for small pages remain unused (and vice-versa). We invent MIX TLBs, energy-frugal set-associative structures that concurrently support all page sizes by exploiting superpage allocation patterns. MIX TLBs boost the performance (often by 10-30%) of big-memory applications on native CPUs, virtualized CPUs, and GPUs. MIX TLBs are simple and require no OS or program changes.},

Recent work has demonstrated an alternative software only design that can result in simplified hardware requirements, even supporting purely physical addressing. While we have made the case for this Compiler- And Runtime-based Address Translation (CARAT) concept, its evaluation was based on a user-level prototype. We now report on incorporating CARAT into a kernel, forming Compiler- And Runtime-based Address Translation for CollAborative Kernel Environments (CARAT CAKE). In our implementation, a Linux-compatible x64 process abstraction can be based either on CARAT CAKE, or on a sophisticated paging implementation. Implementing CARAT CAKE involves kernel changes and compiler optimizations/transformations that must work on all code in the system, including kernel code. We evaluate CARAT CAKE in comparison with paging and find that CARAT CAKE is able to achieve the functionality of paging (protection, mapping, and movement properties) with minimal overhead. In turn, CARAT CAKE allows significant new benefits for systems including energy savings, larger L1 caches, and arbitrary granularity memory management.},

First, we load the code and data for a distrusted module into its own fault do main, a logically separate portion of the application's address space. Second, we modify the object code of a distrusted module to prevent it from writing or jumping to an address outside its fault domain. Both these software operations are portable and programming language independent.Our approach poses a tradeoff relative to hardware fault isolation: substantially faster communication between fault domains, at a cost of slightly increased execution time for distrusted modules. We demonstrate that for frequently communicating modules, implementing fault isolation in software rather than hardware can substantially improve end-to-end application performance.},

The primitive, called Swapstack, can be used by any language implementation based on LLVM to build higher-level language structures such as continuations, coroutines, and lightweight threads. As part of adding the primitives to LLVM, we have also added compiler support for passing parameters across context switches. Our modified LLVM compiler produces highly efficient code through a combination of exposing the context switching code to existing compiler optimizations, and adding novel compiler optimizations to further reduce the cost of context switches. To demonstrate the generality and efficiency of our primitives, we add one-shot continuations to C++, and provide a simple fiber library that allows millions of fibers to run on multiple cores, with a work-stealing scheduler and fast inter-fiber sychronization. We argue that compiler-supported lightweight context switching can be significantly faster than using a library to switch between contexts, and provide experimental evidence to support the position.},

In this paper, we advocate an alternative construction in which the resources within a server are disaggregated and the datacenter is instead architected as a collection of standalone resources.Disaggregation brings greater modularity to datacenter infrastructure, allowing operators to optimize their deployments for improved efficiency and performance. However, the key enabling or blocking factor for disaggregation will be the network since communication that was previously contained within a single server now traverses the datacenter fabric. This paper thus explores the question of whether we can build networks that enable disaggregation at datacenter scales.},

abstract = {Emerging Multicore SoC SmartNICs, enclosing rich computing resources (e.g., a multicore processor, onboard DRAM, accelerators, programmable DMA engines), hold the potential to offload generic datacenter server tasks. However, it is unclear how to use a SmartNIC efficiently and maximize the offloading benefits, especially for distributed applications. Towards this end, we characterize four commodity SmartNICs and summarize the offloading performance implications from four perspectives: traffic control, computing capability, onboard memory, and host communication.Based on our characterization, we build iPipe, an actor-based framework for offloading distributed applications onto SmartNICs. At the core of iPipe is a hybrid scheduler, combining FCFS and DRR-based processor sharing, which can tolerate tasks with variable execution costs and maximize NIC compute utilization. Using iPipe, we build a real-time data analytics engine, a distributed transaction system, and a replicated key-value store, and evaluate them on commodity SmartNICs. Our evaluations show that when processing 10/25Gbps of application bandwidth, NIC-side offloading can save up to 3.1/2.2 beefy Intel cores and lower application latencies by 23.0/28.0 μs.},

abstract = {Memory disaggregation has attracted great attention recently because of its benefits in efficient memory utilization and ease of management. So far, memory disaggregation research has all taken one of two approaches: building/emulating memory nodes using regular servers or building them using raw memory devices with no processing power. The former incurs higher monetary cost and faces tail latency and scalability limitations, while the latter introduces performance, security, and management problems. Server-based memory nodes and memory nodes with no processing power are two extreme approaches. We seek a sweet spot in the middle by proposing a hardware-based memory disaggregation solution that has the right amount of processing power at memory nodes. Furthermore, we take a clean-slate approach by starting from the requirements of memory disaggregation and designing a memory-disaggregation-native system. We built Clio, a disaggregated memory system that virtualizes, protects, and manages disaggregated memory at hardware-based memory nodes. The Clio hardware includes a new virtual memory system, a customized network system, and a framework for computation offloading. In building Clio, we not only co-design OS functionalities, hardware architecture, and the network system, but also co-design compute nodes and memory nodes. Our FPGA prototype of Clio demonstrates that each memory node can achieve 100&nbsp;Gbps throughput and an end-to-end latency of 2.5&nbsp;µ s at median and 3.2&nbsp;µ s at the 99th percentile. Clio also scales much better and has orders of magnitude lower tail latency than RDMA. It has 1.1\texttimes{} to 3.4\texttimes{} energy saving compared to CPU-based and SmartNIC-based disaggregated memory systems and is 2.7\texttimes{} faster than software-based SmartNIC solutions.},

abstract = {Disaggregated memory can address resource provisioning inefficiencies in current datacenters. Multiple software runtimes for disaggregated memory have been proposed in an attempt to make disaggregated memory practical. These systems rely on the virtual memory subsystem to transparently offer disaggregated memory to applications using a local memory abstraction. Unfortunately, using virtual memory for disaggregation has multiple limitations, including high overhead that comes from the use of page faults to identify what data to fetch and cache locally, and high dirty data amplification that comes from the use of page-granularity for tracking changes to the cached data (4KB or higher).  In this paper, we propose a fundamentally new approach to designing software runtimes for disaggregated memory that addresses these limitations. Our main observation is that we can use cache coherence instead of virtual memory for tracking applications' memory accesses transparently, at cache-line granularity. This simple idea (1) eliminates page faults from the application critical path when accessing remote data, and (2) decouples the application memory access tracking from the virtual memory page size, enabling cache-line granularity dirty data tracking and eviction. Using this observation, we implemented a new software runtime for disaggregated memory that improves average memory access time by 1.7-5X and reduces dirty data amplification by 2-10X, compared to state-of-the-art systems.},

abstract = {The performance of large-scale data-intensive applications running on thousands of machines depends considerably on the performance of the network. To deliver better application performance on rapidly evolving high-bandwidth, low-latency interconnects, researchers have proposed the use of network accelerator devices. However, despite the initial enthusiasm, translating network accelerator's capabilities into high application performance remains a challenging issue.In this paper, we describe our experience and discuss issues that we uncover with network acceleration using Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) capable network controllers (RNICs). RNICs offload the complete packet processing into network controllers, and provide direct userspace access to the networking hardware. Our analysis shows that multiple (un)related factors significantly influence the performance gains for the end-application. We identify factors that span the whole stack, ranging from low-level architectural issues (cache and DMA interaction, hardware pre-fetching) to the high-level application parameters (buffer size, access pattern). We discuss implications of our findings upon application performance and the future of integration of network acceleration technology within the systems.},

abstract = {In recent years, the rapidly increasing number of reads produced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has driven the demand for efficient implementations of sequence alignments in bioinformatics. However, current state-of-the-art approaches are not able to leverage the massively parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs with close-to-peak performance.We present AnySeq/GPU---a sequence alignment library that augments the AnySeq 1 library with a novel approach for accelerating dynamic programming (DP) alignment on GPUs by minimizing memory accesses using warp shuffles and half-precision arithmetic. Our implementation is based on the AnyDSL compiler framework which allows for convenient zero-cost abstractions through guaranteed partial evaluation. We show that our approach achieves over 80% of the peak performance on both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs thereby outperforming the GPU-based alignment libraries Any-Seq 1, GASAL 2, ADEPT, and NVBIO by a factor of at least 3.6 while achieving a median speedup of 19.2X over these tools across different alignment scenarios and sequence lengths when running on the same hardware.This leads to throughputs of up to 1.7 TCUPS (tera cell updates per second) on an NVIDIA GV100, up to 3.3 TCUPS with half-precision arithmetic on a single NVIDIA A100, and up to 3.8 TCUPS on an AMD MI100.
